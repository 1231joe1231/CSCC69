## Pintos

A significant element of this class are programming projects using Pintos. Pintos is a teaching operating system for 80x86. It is simple and small (compared to Linux). On the other hand, it is realistic enough to help you understand core OS concepts in depth. It supports kernel threads, virtual memory, user programs, and file system. But its original implementations are premature or incomplete. Through the projects, you will be strengthening all of these areas of Pintos to make it complete.

These projects are hard. They have a reputation of taking a lot of time. But they are also as rewarding as they are challenging. Since Pintos is designed for 80x86 architecture, at the end of the projects, you could run theoretically the OS that you built on a regular IBM-compatible PC! Of course, during development, running Pintos on bare metal machines each time could be time consuming. Instead, you will run the projects in an x86 emulator running inside a Docker container. 

Projects 1, 2 and 3 are individual projects; lab 3 and 4 are groups of 1-2 people.

Before attempting any of the projects, you should read everything below 

<!-- - [Setup Instructions](https://cs.jhu.edu/~huang/cs318/fall19/project/setup.html)
- [Brief overview of the source tree](https://cs.jhu.edu/~huang/cs318/fall19/project/listing_0.html)
- [Using GDB](https://cs.jhu.edu/~huang/cs318/fall19/project/guide.html) -->
- Getting Started
- Coding Standards
- Project Documentation

You need not read the reference guide, but you may find the information in it valuable from time to time:

- Reference Guide

You'll want to read these once you start work on the projects. Their advice can save you a lot of time:

- Debugging Tools
- Development Tools

Bracketed notations in Pintos source code comments can be looked up in the Bibliography.

This is the same information presented in different forms.

- Pintos documentation table of contents
- All Pintos documentation as a PDF file
